          How To Study and Consume Programming Contents
        </h1>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          When I started programming, I think "I will go deep on this, be
          surrounded by tech subjects 24/7 and I will learn fast and better than
          others Jr's that compete with me.{' '}
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          Damn, I was totally wrong. Listen to a podcast or youtube video while
          we clean our house isn't study! Doesn't matter if I watch 3 hours of
          content, I wasn't paying attention, but will have the sensation that I
          completed my studies for today.
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          When I reallized all that, I stopped immediatly. The shower now is
          time to relax, reestart my brain for my studies that will happen after
          shower. Before, I shower listenning to podcast and don't have the
          willing to hard study after, my brain was always tired.
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          In the same time, one thing that I always listen in this contents was
          that we learn from practice. So I challenged my self: "can I READ
          contents from blogs and forums, and practice personal projects
          literally every day?"
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          The word read is highlighted because we need to read and not watch
          content. When we watch or (worst) just listen, we don't pay attention
          as we should. And don't came to me saying "I always pay attention in
          two or three things, I'm used to it", cause you aren't, X-men. You can
          do two things at same time, but you need to realize and assume to
          yourself that you are always giving up one for the other.
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          After accepted my own challenge, I saw my contributions on Github
          happen more frequently, my learning curve has improved and I could
          start this blog. This makes me very happy, I think that now I'm in the
          right way, junt need keep going, consistently.
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          Well, I still watch youtube videos, tech content, but not exactly what
          I need to study. I understand that this videos are only for
          entertainment and for me be always more familiar with english and tech
          topics overall.{' '}
        </p>
        <p className="article-paragraph">
          So start your own projects, focus on your studies. Realize that your
          future depends on your present and if you like programming and are in
          the beginning of your carrer, you should know that even working on the
          area, in five years you can still be considered a jr developer, or a
          mediocre mid-level, and is that what you really want for yourself five
          years from know?
