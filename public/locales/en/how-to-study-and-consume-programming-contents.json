    "title":"How To Study and Consume Programming Contents",
    "text1":"When I started programming, I think 'I will go deep on this, be surrounded by tech subjects 24/7 and I will learn fast and better than others Jr's that compete with me'.",
    "text2":"Damn, I was totally wrong. Listen to a podcast or youtube video while we clean our house isn't study! Doesn't matter if I watch 3 hours of content, I wasn't paying attention, but will have the sensation that I    completed my studies for today.",
    "text3":"When I reallized all that, I stopped immediatly. The shower now is time to relax, reestart my brain for my studies that will happen after shower. Before, I shower listenning to podcast and don't have the willing to hard study after, my brain was always tired.",
    "text4":"In the same time, one thing that I always listen in this contents was that we learn from practice. So I challenged my self: 'can I READ contents from blogs and forums, and practice personal projects literally every day?'",
    "text5":"The word read is highlighted because we need to read and not watch content. When we watch or (worst) just listen, we don't pay attention as we should. And don't came to me saying 'I always pay attention in two or three things, I'm used to it', cause you aren't, X-men. You can do two things at same time, but you need to realize and assume to yourself that you are always giving up one for the other.",
    "text6":"After accepted my own challenge, I saw my contributions on Github happen more frequently, my learning curve has improved and I could start this blog. This makes me very happy, I think that now I'm in the right way, junt need keep going, consistently.",
    "text7":"Well, I still watch youtube videos, tech content, but not exactly what I need to study. I understand that this videos are only for entertainment and for me be always more familiar with english and tech topics overall.",
    "text8":"So start your own projects, focus on your studies. Realize that your future depends on your present and if you like programming and are in the beginning of your carrer, you should know that even working on the area, in five years you can still be considered a jr developer, or a mediocre mid-level, and is that what you really want for yourself five years from know?",
